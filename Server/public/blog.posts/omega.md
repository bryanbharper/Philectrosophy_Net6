> **READ THIS:** The game discussed below is currently *broken*. I've left the original post intact (below), but I've removed the canvas that housed the game. I've included a zip of the game files below, in case you're the type who enjoys looking at that kind of thing. I *DO* plan on rebuilding the game at some point. It's just a matter of finding the time.

I've been meaning to freshen up my Javascript know-how, and with a week off from school, building a game seemed like a fun way to be "productive". So, I give you OMEGA! The half-baked video game.
