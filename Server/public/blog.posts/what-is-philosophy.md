# An Opinionated View of Philosophy

## Intro

In this post, I'm going to put forward a definition of philosophy.

### Qualification
This post will be a bit strange in that I will not argue for the position I put forward. I'm simply going to state my opinion. Of course, I think my opinion is correct. However, I don't think it's possible to decisively prove that the definition I provide is the correct one.

## Definition
Philosophy is not special. It has no subject-matter. It is a basic activity that everyone does, all the time, in every discipline, with varying degrees of success.

Philosophy is simply the activity of reasoning in the broadest possible sense. To do philosophy well, you need to understand formal and informal logic, and you need practice applying it.

### The Academy
What are academic philosophers doing then? I said that everyone does philosopher everywhere all the time. The same is true of exercise. Even if you don't get out of bed, moving your eyes around is technically exercised. The person who studies or is employed to do philosophy, then, is analogous to a gym rat, athlete, etc... They are doing something we all do, just with more rigor.


## To the Scientist Philosophy Skeptic
Your claim undermines itself.
Furthermore, you're doing philosophy.


## To the Philosopher Philosophy Skeptic
The gym rat who never left the gym. He began to think his gym equipment was the real thing. No wonder he questions what he's doing. He forgot the reason for exercising lay outside the gym.
